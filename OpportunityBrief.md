# üßæ Problem Definition Document ‚Äì Basic Fitness App

## A. Target User
Adults aged 25‚Äì45 who want to improve their physical health but struggle to stick with fitness goals due to lack of structure, feedback, and motivation.

## B. Core Problem
Users fail to achieve fitness goals because:
- They don‚Äôt define goals clearly.
- They don‚Äôt track progress consistently.
- They don‚Äôt get timely, actionable feedback.

## C. Evidence
- **15 user interviews**: 80% say they ‚Äústart strong but lose motivation.‚Äù
- **Survey of 120**: 65% cite ‚Äúno clear progress tracking‚Äù as a major reason for quitting.
- **App store reviews** of competitors highlight similar complaints.

## D. Current Alternatives
- Paper journals  
- Spreadsheets  
- Generic fitness apps (e.g., MyFitnessPal, Fitbit) that are overwhelming or misaligned with goal-based tracking.

## E. Opportunity
A minimalist app that helps users:
- Define clear fitness goals (SMART format)  
- Track progress easily (daily/weekly check-ins)  
- See visual feedback on progress trends
