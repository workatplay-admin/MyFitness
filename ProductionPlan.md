## Quality Assurance & Testing Protocols

### Test-Driven Development Process
1. **Write Test First**: Define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Run Test (Fail)**: Confirm test fails initially
3. **Write Minimal Code**: Implement just enough to pass test
4. **Run Test (Pass)**: Confirm test passes
5. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while maintaining tests
6. **Repeat**: Continue cycle for each feature

### Testing Pyramid
